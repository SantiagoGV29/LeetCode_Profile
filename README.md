# Brief
There you will find the solution already submitted of the easy solution with the optimized form and the solution of the medium exercise.
## Easy
On the easy exercise i used a notation in a set to store every number of the preffix and every number of the suffix then i will substract the lenght of boughts sets in order to get the value of that index position.

## Medium
On this exercise i made a recursion solution using an 2d array to represent which letters i have already seen and marked them, then i use some similar algorithm as an DFS on the matrix. 
1. I made a for loop to look on every place of the matrix
2. On every place i call the recursive function so it willl look for the word starting from that place
3. In the recursion function i use 3 variables, the columns (c), the rows (r), the letter that i will look (L), and i use the 2nd array to know which letters i have seen.
4. I ask if my row or column have pass the limits of the matrix and if i already see that letter and if the letter is not the one that i'm looking for.
5. Once i know i found the letter i mark it on the 2d array and call the funtion on the adjacent spaces up, down, left and right and also increment the letter that i will look.
